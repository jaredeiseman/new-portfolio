# Jared Eiseman's Portfolio

#### Ground work for a personal portfolio

#### By Jared Eiseman

## Description
This is a first draft at a possible design for my personal portfolio. It includes 4 sections (about me, resume, sample work, and contact me) + a landing page. There is an abundance of social media icons with the intention of encouraging engagement with me beyond a glance at my portfolio. Content is currently filler content from a previous portfolio project.

## Objectives
* Flexbox is used for at least 3 major elements/structures (e.g. navbar, page layout, projects gallery)
* Project is built using Sass
* Page is responsive (at least one other screen size)
* At least one example oftransition
* At least one example of transform or animation
* Requirements are in place by 8:00am Monday deadline
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, you can talk through it with an instructor using the correct terminology
